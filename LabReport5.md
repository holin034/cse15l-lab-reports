## My Favorite Lab Activity: The ```grep``` Commands
### How I do the tasks:
- First, I started looking for the ```grep``` commands by using the ```man grep``` command in the terminal which gives out lots of examples of grep command.
- Then, I also use **ChatGPT** to look up how the command is used. 
- Additionally, I used the lecture note to find out some other ```grep``` command ideas as well.

### More ```grep``` commands:
#### 1. ```grep [pattern] [Filename].txt```
- Search for a pattern in a file: The most basic usage of grep is to search for a specific pattern or text string in a file. For example, to search for the word "car" in a file called "transportation.txt", you can use the following command:
```
grep "car" transportation.txt
````
