# Week 1 Lab Report
## How to Install VSCode
* Since I have already installed VSCode in the fall quarter for CSE11, I no longer need to install it again.
* However, if you don't have VSCode downloaded, first, you need to go to this [link](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
* Then, when you open the link, follow the directions to download your VSCode on your computer.
* After you have successfully downloaded your VSCode, the home page should look like this:

## How to Access Remote Connecting
1. First, you should open a new terminal by using the terminal option in menu bar and click on open a new terminal.

3. Next, you should type in this command in your newly created terminal:
```
ssh cs15lwi23(your account name)@ieng6.ucsd.edu
```
4. Then, you will be asked a question and will need to type "yes" to answer that question. (see below)
```
ssh cs15lwi23zz@ieng6.ucsd.edu
The authenticity of host 'ieng6.ucsd.edu (128.54.70.227)' can't be established.
RSA key fingerprint is SHA256:ksruYwhnYH+sySHnHAtLUHngrPEyZTDl/1x99wUQcec.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/[fingerprint])? 
```
4. After that, you must type in your newly created password.(Type your password carefully since you won't be able to see what you've typed)
5. Lastly, congrats, your terminal is connected to a computer in the lab room!

## Try out Some Interesting Commands
* After you have successfully logged in, you will be able to type some commands.
* You can always type in some commands like pwd, cd, ls, cp, etc, and see what will happen.
* Some command functions:
1. `pwd` will display your current directory.
2. `cd` will change your current directory to the given path.
3. `ls` will display all the files and folders in the given path.
4. `mkdir` will make new directory.
5. `cp` will create a copy of the contents of a file or directory.

## Conclusion
Overall, in today's lab, I have gone through how to set up my terminal connection remotely, and I have also tried out commands to see how they will work out. Addtionally, I created a new GitHub account and learned introductory knowledge for making websites.
