## My Favorite Lab Activity: The ```grep``` Commands
### How I do the tasks:
- First, I started looking for the ```grep``` commands by using the ```man grep``` command in the terminal which gives out lots of examples of grep command.
- Then, I also use **ChatGPT** to look up how the command is used. 
- Additionally, I used the lecture note to find out some other ```grep``` command ideas as well.
